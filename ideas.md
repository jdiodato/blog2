Yesterday, February 23, 2023, the Department of Education sent the following email to all substitute teachers:

Historically, New York state has required uncertified substitute teachers who worked more than 40 days per school year to provide proof of completing 6 credits of teacher education, up to a total of 21 credits. Hitting this 21 credit limit allows one to be classified as a "certified substitute teacher" as opposed to an uncertifiied substitute teacher." The only meaningful difference is that certified substitutes do not have to complete any more ecucational credits, as a certified sub teacher does not hold a teaching certification issued by NYSED unless they make it a point to get one. This requirement is laid out in [Commissionerâ€™s Regulations Section 80-5.4](https://govt.westlaw.com/nycrr/Document/I364d11cbc22211ddb29d8bee567fca9f?viewType=FullText&originationContext=documenttoc&transitionType=CategoryPageItem&contextData=(sc.Default)).

With this guidance, it 2022-2023 marks the third year in a row that sub teachers who work more than 40 days in a school year are exempt from the professional credit requirement. 

However, this news was not received particularly well by many subs given that we've spent the entire school year being told by the NYC DOE and UFT that subs would be required to complete the professional education credits in order to renew for the 2023-2024 school year. The reason that many substitute teachers are upset is because they've invested time and resources into finding courses that would satisfy the credit requirement.

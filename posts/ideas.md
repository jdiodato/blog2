I recently moved my blog from a generic Wordpress.com site to a static site generated by [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). This kind of setup generally isn't worth the hassle for most folks, but is great for those who like to tinker and mess around with the technology. There are no glaring faults so far, but I'm sure that I'll run into some growing pains as I get used to this new environment. I really enjoy writing in plain text, which is then compiled into a more readable form with [markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/).

There are some super minor things that I'll look to tweak and learn over time, but I'm geneerally fine with figuring them out as I go:
- Enabling Google Analytics
- Possibly adding a comments section. Antonio Piras already did a [deep dive](https://dev.to/antopiras89/add-comments-to-your-static-blog-with-utterances-3jao) into some options to implement a comments section, and it looks like [utterances](https://utteranc.es/) might be exactly what I'm looking for. I'm generally lukewarm on the utility of blog comments these days, as it generally seems that they become spam cesspools. It seems that many thoughts/comments/responses worth sharing generally come in the form of posts being shared on social media. 
- Tweaking the template that my site uses to compile blog posts. I'd like to move tags to the top of the post, along with the date and my name on the chance that someone decides to save a copy of a post and pass it around. 
- Finding a good way to save drafts. I don't mind if they're viewable in my public GitHub repo, I just don't want them to show on the site as if they're published. I currently use an `ideas.md` file as a quick fix for ideas and draft posts. It works alright, but I don't like that it leaves a random empty square on the site as if I tried to write a post and it glitched out.
- Website development and [git](https://git-scm.com/) basics. I currently edit blog posts in the Github browser interface, but I really want to also use this blog as an opportunity to get more comfortable with git and version control. 

Many or all of these things could very well be an easy fix by reading through the [11ty docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/), which I'll definitely need to sit down with soon.

Maybe I'm just indecisive, but it took me about a month to really explore different blog options and find one that resonated with me. I'm looking forward to getting more comfortable with 11ty over time and adding more tweaks over time to make it more suitable to my taste and preferences. That being said, I'm now free to go back to running my mouth about how the UFT and city are failing public sector rank and file workers.
